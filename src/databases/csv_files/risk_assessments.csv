This could facilitate spoofing attacks, compromising DNS integrity."", ""Tampering"": ""Grover’s algorithm may weaken symmetric cryptography in DNSSEC, compromising hashing algorithms like SHA1, SHA2, and SHA3. This vulnerability could allow for tampering with DNS records, redirecting users to malicious sites, or intercepting communication.""}"
